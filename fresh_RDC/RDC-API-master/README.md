## Regent-Dependent Creativity API

In order to complement the study cases in this article, an API for evaluating artifacts was developed. Only two inputs are necessary for evaluating an artifact: a knowledge database that contains existing artifacts of the particular application domain, and a set of relations that represent the synergy among the artifacts’ attributes. The knowledge database must contain artifacts encoded in a specific format, such as JSON. In the first example, where clothing items are combined to form an apparel, the knowledge database has the following format:

```
[ {
"clothingItems": [{
"type": "SHIRT",
"color": "LILAC"
}, {
"type": "PANTS",
"color": "WHITE"
}, {
"type": "SHOES",
"color": "GRAY"
}]
}, 
...
]
```

A specialized parser is responsible for converting the encoded knowledge database into a collection of instances of artifact objects. The decoded collection of artifact objects is depicted bellow:

```
{
"1":[0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],
"2":[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
...
"9":[0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]
}
```

Relations representing the synergy of the artifacts are structured as a map between each attribute and its respective synergistic attributes. These relations are illustrated below, describing the synergy among the colors and their clothing items. The API supports the synergistic relations to be represented as follows:

```
{
"WHITE":["NAVY", "BLACK", "BLUE", "GRAY", "LILAC", "BROWN"],
"BLACK":["NAVY", "BROWN", "WHITE", "BLUE", "LILAC", "GRAY"],
"NAVY":["GRAY", "BLACK", "WHITE", "BLUE", "BROWN"],
"BLUE":["NAVY", "BLACK", "WHITE", "GRAY", "BROWN"],
"GRAY":["NAVY", "BLACK", "WHITE", "BLUE", "LILAC"],
"BROWN":["NAVY", "BLACK", "WHITE", "BLUE"],
"LILAC":["BLACK", "WHITE", "GRAY"]
}
```

When the parser loads the knowledge database, it computes the averages and variance of each attribute among all loaded artifacts. These information is necessary to the calculation of RDC metric. The two main classes in the Regent-Dependent creativity metric are: the **SynergyValue** class, responsible for calculating the value metric, in which the method _getValue(T artifact)_ will return the synergistic value of the artifact given as parameter; and the **BayesianSurprise** class, responsible for calculating the novelty metric, by using the method _getNovelty(T artifact)_. With a measure of novelty and value, the _evaluateArtifact(Context context, Artifact artifact)_ method in **ArtifactJudge** class, judges how creative is an artifact in the specified context.

### How to run the RDC API:

1. Download files (to avoid jarfile corruption, get the rdcAPI.jar file using "Download Zip" option);
2. Extract files;
3. Open cmd prompt (windows) or shell (linux);
4. Go to extracted files directory;
4. Run command **java -jar rdcAPI.jar \<shirt color\> \<pants color\> \<shoes color\>**;
  
```  
Possible values:
	
<shirt color>: "BLUE", "GRAY", "LILAC", "NAVY", "WHITE"
<pants color>: "BLACK", "BROWN", "GRAY", "NAVY", "WHITE"
<shoes color>: "BLACK", "BROWN", "GRAY", "NAVY", "WHITE"

Example: java -jar rdcAPI.jar LILAC NAVY BROWN
```
